# WIP! Cate 3.0
Cate 3.0 is going to be written in C99 with help from a competent programmer.

## Main changes
- No dependencies other than libc.
- `copy()` and `move()` functions.
- It'd likely be faster because we'd be doing 20x less allocations.
- Catel will (possibly) be removed so we could add proper `if(platform)` things.
