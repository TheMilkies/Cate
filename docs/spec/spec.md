# Cate specification (3.0)
This specification was mostly written to kill an hour and to have a baseline for all future Cate endeavors.

Cate is an easy build system for C/C++ with C-like syntax created out of frustration with every other solution. It was intended for small and medium projects but with Cate3, it can handle bigger projects too!

This is the last Cate version and therefore we want it to be as good as possible.
